# Integrating the LeanCTX Context Gateway

> **Context Gateway for AI Systems. Control what your AI can see.**

LeanCTX sits between AI and the systems it reads: **SELECT → CONTROL → PROVE**.
LeanCTX Engine implements context selection, supported controls, and bounded
evidence. LeanCTX SDK connects applications to that runtime.
Within the Engine, the technical context lifecycle is:

    select → shape → reuse → recover

The agent, task logic, model choice, tools, and retry policy remain with the
integrator.

## Available local Runtime

LeanCTX provides local paths for:

- selecting and representing repository and tool context;
- structural views, exact-source recovery, compression, and reuse;
- CLI, MCP, hooks, proxy, and supported coding-agent integration paths;
- local Receipts and offline-verification primitives.

The Runtime is local-first. An integration must state what it can see; it
cannot claim facts about host prompts, decisions, retries, quality, or outcomes
outside that visibility.

## Integration depths

| Depth | Status | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attach | Available | Operate around a supported coding agent through local CLI, MCP, hooks, or proxy paths. |
| Wrap | Preview | Use the declared Python SDK v1 reference-wrapper scope. |
| Embed with the standalone LeanCTX SDK | Available stable contract | Use the released context lifecycle and Agent Tools interfaces; the host retains ownership of its agent loop. Preview namespace operations remain Preview. |

## Research: shared project context

The local Runtime includes session, project knowledge, handoff, and
agent-presence substrate. It can inform future **shared, scoped project
context**: agents reuse bounded decisions, findings, and source references
instead of passing complete transcripts.

This is **Research**, not a supported agent-orchestration product. The host
still assigns work, schedules agents, retries failures, and controls execution.
LeanCTX does not yet provide a public cross-agent coordination, privacy,
freshness, or interoperability contract.

## Scope boundaries

LeanCTX is not a hosted RAG service, universal retrieval layer, multi-agent
platform, marketplace, model router, or generic agent framework. A source
connector, index, provider, plugin, or implementation module does not itself
create a public product promise.

The standalone SDK's released ContextPlan belongs to its stable lifecycle.
Older planning proposals do not set that package's status. Performance Profiles,
first-class Context Kits, and cross-agent product directions remain Research.
Commercial Enterprise organization capabilities have a separate contract and
license; they are not promoted or demoted by this Engine guide. See
[current positioning](../POSITIONING_CANONICAL.md) and [SDK boundaries](../reference/sdk-surface.md).

## Evidence

A context reduction or calculated cost is an observation of one declared
workload. A valid performance claim needs comparable baseline and treatment,
a declared quality threshold, visible methodology, and inspectable evidence.
